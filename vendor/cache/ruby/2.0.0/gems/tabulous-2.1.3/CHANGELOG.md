### 2.1.2 (Dec 22, 2014)
* Added support for Rails 4.2 and Ruby 2.2.

### 2.1.1 (May 28, 2014)
* Added support for Rails 4.1 and Ruby 2.1.

### 2.1.0 (Nov 9, 2013)
* Added http_verb tab declaration to support non-GET actions, like sign out links.
* Added renderer that generates HTML compatible with Bootstrap 3's navbar.
* Documentation tweaks.
* Added better float-clearing styles in CSS scaffolding.

### 2.0.0 (May 12, 2013)
* Introduced a completely new, non-backwards-compatible syntax for app/tabs/tabulous.rb.
* You can have more than one tab navigation bar on the same page.
* You can customize the generated tab markup by creating your own renderer class.
* Namespaced controllers are now fully supported.
* The active tab is now clickable by default.
* When tabulous cannot determine which tab to make active based on the controller action, the
  default behavior used to be to throw an error.  Now it is to not render the tabs.
* The default markup uses class="tabs" and class="subtabs" instead of id="tabs" and id="subtabs".
* The default markup no longer adds the classes "enabled" or "inactive" to tabs, as these are a bit
  redundant in the presence of "disabled" and "active" classes.
* Ruby 1.8 is no longer supported.
